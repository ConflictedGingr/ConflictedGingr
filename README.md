- 👋 Hi, I’m @ConflictedGingr
- 👀 I’m interested in anything tech and car related. I also really enjoy challenges and trying to solve problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use html, css, and Java script for front-end development but will be pushing my-self to learn back-end related stuff and also going to try some data based stuff. Maybe later on after I have become more effiecient I will learn even more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to help me develope more efficiency and knowledge in front-end and back-end developement.
- 📫 How to reach me you can reach me by email: conflictedginger@gmail.com, twitter(X): @CGinger817, or discord: conflictedginger
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have quit my learning in development and coding several times between dropping out of college and just giving up with self learning to take care of my kids and wife and spend more time with them, but this last year has made me realize I would love to actually finish learning it to build a career with it so I have a better life for my kids.
